<h3 align="center"><b><u>1. Paris Has 5 Statues Of Liberty</u></b></h3>
This might come as a surprising Paris fact to many as the most known one is in New York but Paris also has a number of replicas of Statues of Liberty.
<br>
Actually, even the one in New York was gifted to the US by the French — something I am sure not many people knew.

<h3 align="center"><b><u> 2. Paris Has One Of The Most Famous Paintings In The World</u></b></h3>
<p>
The Louvre Museum in Paris houses the most prestigious and most famous painting in the world, the Monalisa by Leonardo da Vinci.
<br>
Even though the painting is popular, so many people are always surprised by how small it is when they see it in real life — it is 77 cm x 53 cm to be exact.</p><hr>

<p>
Paris is undeniably a beautiful city but it also has darkness beneath its walls — a full city of darkness commonly known as the Paris underground city. This city is called “The Catacombs”.
<br>
Even though today the Catacombs are one of the places to visit in Paris to learn more about the city’s history, it’s still a dark place that holds over 6 million remains of Parisians. You can learn more about it by reading these Paris catacombs facts.

One of the nicknames for Paris is the City of Light! I am sure almost everyone knows this as one of the facts in Paris. But what most people don’t know is how it assumed this nickname.
