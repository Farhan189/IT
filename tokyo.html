<h3 align="center"><b><u>01 TOKYO TOWER</u></b></h3>
<p>
One of the most striking places to visit in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower, perhaps the most recognizable structure in all of Japan.<br> Although it is primarily a communications tower, visitors can climb to the summit to observe a panoramic view of Tokyo. <br>The tower is also heavily inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris in its structure and architecture. <br>The tower is a symbol of Japanese recovery after the Second World War and the fact that the country has now become a major economic superpower.

<h3 align="center"><b><u>02 TOKYO SKYTREE</u></b></h3>
<p>
Another very recognizable landmark in Tokyo is the Tokyo Skytree.<br> One of the most recommended places to visit in Tokyo is a towering structure that is the tallest building in Japan. <br>In fact, when the Skytree was built, it was the second tallest building in the world, standing at a height of 634 metres.

<h3 align="center"><b><u>03 TOKYO DISNEYLAND</u></b></h3>
<p>
This massive, 115-acre large theme park is one of the best places to visit in Tokyo, whether you are travelling alone or with kids or with your partner. <br>It is the very first Disneyland to have been built outside of the United States and is to date, one of the main attractions in Japan. <br>Apart from mind-boggling rides and incredible food, you can also explore Tokyo DisneySea, which is an adjoining waterpark that is just as lavish.
